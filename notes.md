### Potential Research Topics (I'm open to discussion and cooperation!)

- VQ-Diffusion for Music-Driven Dance Motion Generation
  - Motivation: Memory for de-noising, Diffusion to avoid auto-regressive errors.
  - Related Works: [Pose-GPT](https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/computer-vision/posegpt/), [VQ-Diffusion](https://github.com/microsoft/VQ-Diffusion), [EDGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10658)

- Conditional Motion In-betweening with Self-Supervised Augmentation
  - Motivation: Long duration In-betweening, guidance requires a large amount of data
  - Related Works: [Conditional Motion In-betweening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04307?context=cs.AI)
  - Task Formulation: Unconstrained In-betweening, Pose-conditioned In-betweening, Semantic-conditioned In-betweening
  - Downstram Tasks: Motion Completion or Interpolation, Motion Editing, Motion-Motion Transition

### Suggestions for beginners

- Early (1-2 weeks)
  - What's your research topic? Choose a topic on the rise, e.g. diffusion but for new tasks.
  - What's the problems or challenges with existing methods? Read related works, always start from a clear motivation.
  - Which codebase do you adopt? Get familar a common-adopted and flexible codebase to get started.
- Mid-term (4-12 weeks)
  - Design your pipeline. For each challenge, you need to propose corresponding solution.
  - Design your experiment setting. Carefully select your datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics.
  - Write paper.
- Late (2-3 weeks)
  - Ask others to review.
  - Polish paper and submit.
