Potential Research Topics (I'm open to discussion and cooperation!)

- VQ-Diffusion for Music-Driven Dance Motion Generation
  - Motivation: Memory for de-noising, Diffusion to avoid auto-regressive errors.
  - Related Works: [Pose-GPT](https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/computer-vision/posegpt/), [VQ-Diffusion](https://github.com/microsoft/VQ-Diffusion), [EDGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10658)

- Conditional Motion In-betweening with Self-Supervised Augmentation
  - Motivation: Long duration In-betweening, guidance requires a large amount of data
  - Related Works: [Conditional Motion In-betweening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04307?context=cs.AI)
  - Task Formulation: Unconstrained In-betweening, Pose-conditioned In-betweening, Semantic-conditioned In-betweening
  - Downstram Tasks: Motion Completion or Interpolation, Motion Editing, Motion-Motion Transition
